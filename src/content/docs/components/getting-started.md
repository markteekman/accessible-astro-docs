## Overview

A set of Accessible, easy to use, Front-end UI Components for [Astro](https://astro.build/). Most of these components
are used in the [Accessible
Astro Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter) and
the [Accessible Astro Dashboard](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-dashboard) themes, and they provide
exemplary use cases for these components. As a
bonus, these themes also have their own dedicated components (like keyboard accessible and responsive navigations) and
many **Design System** utility classes, patterns and primitives (such as grids, buttons, lists, spacings, sizes and more).
